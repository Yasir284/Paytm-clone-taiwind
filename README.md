# Paytm Clone-With Tailwind

- This is my first project made with Tailwind CSS. I have made Paytm clone only using Tailwind CSS. It is mobile responsive and i have added some hovering effects to it. I learned a lot about Tailwind by making this site.

- It took me 1 day to complete this project, as it was my first time using tailwind it was quite hard but was an amazing experience.
